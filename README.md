Welcome to the **7-Day Observability Masterclass** – a **hands-on, metrics-driven learning program** designed to transform your Kubernetes monitoring, logging, and tracing skills from **0 to production-ready**.

Across these 7 days, you’ll gain **100% practical, deployment-focused experience** with industry-grade tools like:

- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana**
- **Elasticsearch**
- **Fluentbit**
- **Kibana**
- **Jaeger**
- **groundcover (eBPF)**
- **OpenTelemetry**

By the end of this program, you’ll have a **fully functional observability stack** capable of:
- Monitoring **10,000+ metrics/sec**
- Handling **10M+ logs/day**
- Tracing requests across **50+ microservices**
- Reducing MTTR by **up to 60%**
